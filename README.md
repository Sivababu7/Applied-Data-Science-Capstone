# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
SpaceX Data Science Capstone Project

Introduction
SpaceX, a trailblazer in the space industry, is committed to democratizing space travel. Their achievements include launching spacecraft to the International Space Station, deploying a satellite constellation for global internet access, and conducting manned missions to space. One of SpaceX’s cost-saving innovations is the reuse of the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket, which significantly reduces launch expenses compared to other providers.

Project Objective
In this data science capstone project, we delve into SpaceX’s dataset to predict whether the first stage of their rockets will successfully land. By analyzing factors such as payload mass, launch site, flight history, and orbits, we aim to uncover insights that contribute to successful landings.

Key Steps
Data Collection: We gather data using SpaceX’s REST API and web scraping techniques.
Data Wrangling: We clean and preprocess the data to create a success/fail outcome variable.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We visualize and explore the impact of various factors on landing success rates.
Predictive Analytics: We build machine learning models (logistic regression, SVM, decision tree, and K-nearest neighbor) to predict landing outcomes.
Results
Launch success has improved over time.
KSC LC-39A stands out with the highest success rate among landing sites.
Orbits ES-L1, GEO, HEO, and SSO have a 100% success rate.
